Nikola Tesla: The Wizard of Electricity

Nikola Tesla was a brilliant Serbian-American inventor and engineer. Known as the "mad scientist" of his time, he pioneered the use of alternating current (AC) electricity, which powers our world today. His inventions, like the AC motor and the Tesla coil, revolutionized technology. 

Despite his genius, Tesla struggled financially and was often overshadowed by his rival, Thomas Edison. His dream of wireless power transmission and communication remained unrealized. Yet, his legacy lives on, and he's considered one of history's greatest minds.
